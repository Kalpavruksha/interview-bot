# MCQ Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the hybrid Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) system for the AI Interview Assistant application. The system provides a more objective and easily scorable interview format while maintaining the ability to test complex technical concepts.

## Hybrid Question Structure

### Question Types and Difficulty Levels

1. **Q1 & Q2: Easy MCQs** (20 seconds each)
   - Basic concept questions
   - Straightforward syntax/API knowledge
   - Four options with one correct answer

2. **Q3 & Q4: Medium MCQs** (60 seconds each)
   - Scenario-based questions
   - Practical application of concepts
   - Requires some reasoning and analysis

3. **Q5 & Q6: Hard MCQs** (120 seconds each)
   - Pseudocode-based questions
   - Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving
   - Complex technical scenarios

## Implementation Details

### 1. AI-Powered Question Generation

#### Function: `generateMCQInterviewQuestions()`
Located in `src/utils/geminiAPI.js`

**Key Features:**
- Generates personalized questions based on candidate's resume
- Creates a balanced mix of difficulty levels
- Includes both standard MCQs and pseudocode-based questions
- Randomizes options for each question to prevent cheating
- Provides detailed explanations for each answer

**Prompt Structure:**
```javascript
const prompt = `Generate 6 multiple-choice interview questions for a candidate with the following background:
  
  Name: ${candidateInfo?.name || 'Candidate'}
  Resume Content: ${candidateInfo?.text || 'No resume content provided'}
  
  The questions should be tailored to their experience and categorized as follows:
  - Q1 & Q2: Easy MCQs (20 seconds each)
  - Q3 & Q4: Medium MCQs (scenario-based, 60 seconds each)
  - Q5 & Q6: Hard MCQs (pseudocode-based, but still with multiple options, 120 seconds each)
  
  Format the response as a JSON array with each object having:
  {
    "id": number,
    "type": "mcq" or "mcq-pseudocode",
    "question": "string",
    "options": ["string", "string", "string", "string"],
    "answer": "A" or "B" or "C" or "D",
    "explanation": "string explaining why the answer is correct",
    "difficulty": "easy" or "medium" or "hard",
    "timeLimit": 20 or 60 or 120
  }`
```

### 2. Question Structure

Each question follows this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "type": "mcq-pseudocode",
  "question": "Which pseudocode correctly reverses a linked list?",
  "options": [
    "prev = null\nwhile (head != null)\n  next = head.next\n  head.next = prev\n  prev = head\n  head = next",
    "while (head != null)\n  head = head.next\n  head.next = prev",
    "for each node in list\n  swap(node, node.next)",
    "reverse(list)\n  return list.next"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The correct approach uses three pointers (prev, current, next) to reverse the direction of links in the list.",
  "difficulty": "hard",
  "timeLimit": 120
}
```

### 3. Randomization Features

#### Option Shuffling
- Options are shuffled for each question to prevent pattern recognition
- Correct answer index is updated accordingly
- Maintains question integrity while adding randomness

#### Dynamic Generation
- Each interview session generates new questions
- No two candidates receive identical question sets
- Questions are tailored to candidate's background

### 4. Answer Validation

#### Function: `validateAnswer()`
Located in `src/utils/validation.js`

**Validation Schema:**
```javascript
const answerSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number().optional(),
  questionId: z.number().positive('Question ID is required'),
  question: z.string().min(1, 'Question text is required'),
  selectedOption: z.string().min(1, 'Selected option is required'),
  timestamp: z.string().optional(),
  score: z.number().optional(),
  correct: z.boolean().optional(),
  explanation: z.string().optional()
})
```

### 5. Scoring System

#### Automatic Scoring
- Correct answers: 100 points
- Incorrect/skipped answers: 0 points
- Final score: Percentage of correct answers

#### AI-Powered Summary
Function: `generateMCQCandidateSummary()`
- Analyzes candidate's performance across all questions
- Generates professional 2-3 sentence summary
- Highlights strengths and areas for improvement

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. InterviewChat Component
Located in `src/components/InterviewChat.jsx`

**Key Features:**
- Radio button interface for MCQ selection
- Visual indicators for difficulty levels
- Type tags (MCQ vs Pseudocode)
- Automatic answer submission on timeout
- Detailed progress tracking

### 2. UI Components

#### Question Display
- Secure question display with anti-copy measures
- Difficulty level tags (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Question type indicators (MCQ, Pseudocode)

#### Answer Interface
- Radio button options with clear labeling
- Visual feedback for selected options
- Submit button with validation

#### Timer Integration
