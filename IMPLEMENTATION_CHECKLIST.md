- [x] Auto-submit Handler

### Validation Service ⚠️
- [ ] Email/Phone Validator
- [ ] Resume File Check (basic validation implemented)

### Export Service ⚠️
- [ ] PDF Generation
- [ ] CSV Export

## 🔄 KEY DATA FLOWS

### Flow 1: Resume Upload → Interview Start ✅
1. [x] Candidate uploads resume → Resume Parser extracts data
2. [x] Data saved to Candidates Slice → Persisted to localStorage via Redux Persist
3. [x] Missing fields? → Chatbot collects info → Update state
4. [x] Complete? → Create Session → Call AI for Q1 → Start timer
5. [x] Display question in Chat Interface

### Flow 2: Answer Submission → Next Question ✅
1. [x] Timer expires OR Submit clicked → Auto-submit answer
2. [x] Save answer to Current Session → Call AI to evaluate
3. [x] AI returns score → Update session state → Persist
4. [x] currentIndex++ → Generate next question → Reset timer
5. [x] If Q6 done → Generate AI Summary → Show completion

### Flow 3: Dashboard View → Candidate Details ✅
1. [x] Interviewer opens dashboard → Load all candidates from Redux
2. [x] Apply filters/sorting → Render Candidate Cards
3. [x] Click candidate → Fetch full session data from Redux state
4. [x] Display Detail Modal → Show Q&A, scores, AI summary
5. [ ] Export option → Generate PDF/CSV from session data

## Additional Features Implemented

### Security Measures ✅
- [x] Anti-copying measures for questions
- [x] Keyboard shortcut blocking
- [x] Context menu prevention
- [x] Text selection prevention

### Welcome Back Feature ✅
- [x] Detects unfinished interviews
- [x] Shows modal for resuming
- [x] Preserves all state

### Tab Synchronization ✅
- [x] Shared Redux store between tabs
- [x] Real-time updates
- [x] Consistent state across tabs

## Areas for Improvement

1. **IndexedDB Implementation**: Currently using localStorage via Redux Persist instead of IndexedDB
2. **Export Functionality**: Data is available but no export buttons implemented
3. **Advanced Validation**: Basic validation implemented but could be enhanced
4. **Session Storage**: Not fully utilizing session storage for temporary state

## Summary

The application successfully implements all core requirements from the specification:

✅ **All major user flows are implemented**
✅ **State management is properly structured**
✅ **Persistence works through Redux Persist**
✅ **AI integration is functional**
✅ **Tab synchronization is working**
✅ **Security measures are in place**
✅ **Welcome back functionality works**

The main areas that could be enhanced are:
- Implementing IndexedDB for better data storage
- Adding export functionality (PDF/CSV generation)
- Enhancing validation services
- Better utilization of session storage
